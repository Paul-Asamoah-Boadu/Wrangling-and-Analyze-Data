    "WeRateDogs Twitter datasets were given to the students to wrangle and analyze. Three datasets make up this project: \n",

    "3. tweet_json.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was gathered, assessed, and cleaned before the following insights were produced.\n",

    "<img src=\"Period has highest activity.png\" alt=\"Period with highest activity\">\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the above graph, the majority of tweets occur between the hours of 0:00 and 5:00 and midday between 14 and 23, however tweet volume between 6 and 14 is extremely low. This indicates that there aren't almost any tweets during working hours.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the right-hand chart, Clumber has the highest rating there with a 2.7. While the Pomeranian was ranked as the 10th best breed with 1.3 points. The chart on the left, however, displays the dog breeds with the lowest ratings. The Japanese Spaniel had the lowest rating of any dog breed with 0.5.\n",

    "The heatmap demonstrates that most numerical variables have weak correlations with one another. Focusing on the correlation between the favourite count and the retweet count. The scatter plot indicates there is a strong positive correlation between these variables as they have correlation of 0.93 also shown in the heatmap.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between dog stage and retweet count is also illustrated in __Fig. 2__. This shows that with 16,000 counts, Doggo, Puppo has the most retweets, followed by Doggo with 6,000. With roughly 2000 retweets, Pupper has the lowest number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Fig. 3__ also represents the relationship between the dog stage and favorite count. According to the graph, Doggo, Puppo had a 40,000 favorite count, while Pupper had a 6000 favorite count as the lowest recorded.\n",

    "<h2> Conclusion </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of the WeRateDogs Twitter datasets found that there are specific patterns and trends in the dog-related content shared on the platform. It was discovered that the majority of tweets occur during the early hours of the day and in the evenings, with very little activity during working hours. This emphasizes how crucial it is to comprehend the habits and routines of the target audience when developing social media strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis also determined which dog breeds had the highest and lowest ratings, with Clumber having the highest rating and Japanese Spaniel having the lowest. Favorite count and retweet count have a strong positive connection, indicating that they are closely related metrics and that increasing either one will probably raise the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis also looked at how dog phases are distributed and related to one another, as well as how they affect favorite and retweet counts. Pupper was found to be the most prevalent dog stage, followed by Doggo, with Doggo, Puppo and Doggo, Floofer having the lowest frequency, according to the findings. Doggo, Puppo received the most retweets and favorites.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, social media managers and dog owners may use this study to better understand the concerns and trends on the WeRateDogs Twitter platform and provide more relevant and interesting content for their followers.\n"
